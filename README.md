# Virtual-Machine-and-Operating-System
I was assigned a project for my Operating Systems class in which I design and implement a program that simulates an OS that runs on a virtual machine. My source code and documentation is stored in this repository.

## Summary and Background Information
This project is set up in two phases, each of which has two parts. The first phase focuses on the fundamental structure of the machine and operating system. Specifically, the first phase focuses on implementing the CPU (single core for part one, multicore for part two), loader, scheduler, and DMA channel.
